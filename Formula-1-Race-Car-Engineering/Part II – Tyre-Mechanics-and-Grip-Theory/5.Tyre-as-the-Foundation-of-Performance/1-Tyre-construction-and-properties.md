# F1 Tyre Compounds – The Pirelli "Rainbow"

Tyres are critical in Formula 1 as the sole contact point between car and track, influencing grip, temperature management, wear, lap times, and strategy.

Since 2011, Pirelli supplies F1 tyres, offering multiple slick compounds plus intermediates and wets. The 2018 season featured the most extensive slick range, dubbed the **Pirelli Rainbow** for its colour-coded system.

## 🔍 Tyre Construction & Specs

- **Tread Compound:** Rubber blends optimised for grip, heat, and wear.  
- **Carcass:** Synthetic fibres and steel belts give stiffness and strength.  
- **Sidewall:** Controls flex and steering feel.  
- **Bead:** Locks tyre to wheel rim under high lateral forces.

**2018 slicks specs:**  
Diameter: 670 mm | Width: 305 mm front / 405 mm rear | Weight: ~8.5 kg front / ~10 kg rear | Pressure: ~21 psi front / ~19 psi rear

## 🌦️ Weather Conditions & Tyre Choice

- **Dry & Hot:** Use harder compounds (Superhard, Hard) to prevent overheating and blistering.  
- **Dry & Mild/Warm:** Medium and Soft compounds offer a balance of grip and durability.  
- **Dry & Cool:** Softer compounds like Ultrasoft and Hypersoft warm up better, giving more grip.  
- **Light Rain/Damp:** Intermediate tyres (Green) disperse moderate water, maintain grip on drying surfaces.  
- **Heavy Rain:** Full wet tyres (Blue) with deep grooves prevent aquaplaning on flooded tracks.  
- **Snow:** F1 does not race; sessions are delayed or cancelled.

---

## 🏎️ Strategic Impact

- **Qualifying:** Use softest tyres available for maximum grip.  
- **Race:** Balance between tyre life and pace, considering track and weather.  
- **Track Specific:** High degradation tracks favour harder tyres; low degradation tracks allow softer tyre strategies.  
- **Weather Specific:** Tyres chosen based on temperature and moisture to maintain optimal grip and durability.

## ⚠️ Important Points About F1 Tyres

- **Tyre Warm-up is Key:**  
  Tyres perform best when in their optimal temperature range. Too cold causes graining and poor grip; too hot accelerates degradation and blistering.

- **Track Surface & Weather Impact Performance:**  
  Different asphalt types, temperatures, and humidity levels affect how a tyre compound behaves.

- **Pit Stop Strategy is Tyre-Driven:**  
  Teams plan their race strategy mainly around tyre wear and degradation, sometimes sacrificing outright speed for fewer stops.

- **Safety Regulations:**  
  The FIA mandates minimum pressures, maximum speeds, and limits on tyre use to ensure safety.

- **Tyre Allocation Limits:**  
  Drivers receive a limited number of tyre sets per race weekend, making management vital.

- **Wet Tyres vs Slicks:**  
  Intermediates and full wets cannot be used on dry tracks as they overheat quickly; slicks on wet tracks offer almost no grip and are unsafe.

- **Post-2019 Simplification:**  
  The complex rainbow system was replaced by three compounds per race (Hard - White, Medium - Yellow, Soft - Red) to simplify strategies for fans.

## 📌 Notes

- Post-2019, Pirelli simplified slick tyres to 3 compounds per race, labelled Hard (White), Medium (Yellow), and Soft (Red), regardless of actual base compound (C1–C5).  
- Wet tyres (Intermediate Green and Full Wet Blue) remain distinct categories.
