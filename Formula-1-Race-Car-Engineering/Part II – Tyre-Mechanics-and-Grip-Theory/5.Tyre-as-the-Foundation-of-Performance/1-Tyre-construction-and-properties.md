## 🛞 F1 Tyre Compounds – The Pirelli "Rainbow"

In Formula 1, tyres are one of the most critical performance factors. They are the only point of contact between the car and the track, and their grip, temperature management, and wear characteristics directly influence lap times, strategy, and race outcomes.

From 2011 onwards, **Pirelli** has been the sole tyre supplier in F1, producing multiple **slick (dry)** compounds, as well as intermediate and wet-weather tyres.  
The 2018 season featured the most extensive range of slick compounds, nicknamed the **Pirelli Rainbow** due to the colour-coding system.

### 🔍 Tyre Construction & Properties

An F1 tyre is a highly engineered structure designed to handle enormous loads, speeds exceeding 350 km/h, and rapid changes in temperature and grip.

**Main components:**
1. **Tread Compound**  
   - Specialised rubber blend optimised for grip, heat resistance, and wear.  
   - Formula 1 slick compounds vary in hardness, affecting grip and durability.  
   - Designed to work in a specific **temperature window** (e.g., 80–110°C for soft tyres).

2. **Carcass (Body)**  
   - Layers of synthetic fibres (e.g., nylon, polyester) and **steel belts** for structural integrity.  
   - Determines stiffness, cornering response, and resistance to deformation under load.

3. **Sidewall**  
   - Controls tyre flex and steering feedback.  
   - Stiffer sidewalls = sharper response, but harsher ride.  
   - More flexible sidewalls = better compliance, but slower transitions.

4. **Bead**  
   - Reinforced edge that locks tyre to the wheel rim.  
   - Must withstand high lateral forces without slipping.

**F1-specific parameters (2018 Pirelli slicks):**
- **Diameter:** 670 mm (including tread)  
- **Width:** 305 mm (front), 405 mm (rear)  
- **Weight:** ~8.5 kg (front), ~10 kg (rear)  
- **Minimum pressures:** Defined by FIA/Pirelli, vary by track (e.g., 21 psi front, 19 psi rear).  
- **Construction focus:** Balancing grip, thermal behaviour, and predictability over a race stint.

### 📊 Slick Tyre Compounds (2018 Range)

| Compound Name  | Colour     | Grip Level | Durability | Typical Use Case |
|----------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Superhard**  | 🟧 Orange | Lowest     | Highest    | Extreme durability for abrasive tracks, rarely used |
| **Hard**       | 🔵 Blue   | Low        | Very High  | Long stints, high degradation tracks |
| **Medium**     | ⚪ White  | Balanced   | High       | Versatile race tyre, balanced between speed & life |
| **Soft**       | 🟡 Yellow | Medium-High| Medium     | Qualifying + shorter race stints |
| **Supersoft**  | 🔴 Red    | High       | Low        | Maximum grip for short runs, qualifying tyres |
| **Ultrasoft**  | 🟣 Purple | Very High  | Very Low   | Street circuits, high grip but quick degradation |
| **Hypersoft**  | 🌸 Pink   | Extreme    | Shortest   | Highest grip ever in F1, designed for very short stints |

### ⚙️ Compound Characteristics

1. **Grip vs Durability Trade-Off**  
   - Softer tyres provide more grip (faster lap times) but wear out faster.  
   - Harder tyres last longer but offer less peak grip.

2. **Operating Temperature Window**  
   - Each compound works best within a specific temperature range.  
   - Example: Hypersoft optimum ~85–110°C, Superhard optimum ~105–135°C.

3. **Degradation Types**  
   - **Thermal degradation** – Grip loss from overheating.  
   - **Graining** – Rubber shearing from cold or sliding tyres.  
   - **Blistering** – Surface damage from excess heat inside the tyre.

4. **Load Sensitivity**  
   - Grip increases with load (downforce) but with diminishing returns.  
   - Too much power or steering at the wrong time can cause loss of traction.

### 🏎️ Strategic Impact

- **Qualifying:** Teams often use the softest compound available for maximum grip.  
- **Race:** Strategy balances pace and tyre life — sometimes sacrificing speed for fewer pit stops.  
- **Track Specific:**  
  - High-degradation tracks (e.g., Bahrain) favour harder compounds.  
  - Low-degradation tracks (e.g., Monaco) allow aggressive soft tyre usage.

### 📌 Notes

- **Post-2019**, Pirelli simplified the colour system to just 3 compounds per race:  
  - C1 to C5 base compounds → labelled as Hard (White), Medium (Yellow), Soft (Red) regardless of actual hardness.
- Wet-weather tyres (Green for Intermediates, Blue for Full Wets) are a separate category.
