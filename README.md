## 📜 Project Description

This repository is a **personal learning project** created by a **software developer aspiring to become a Formula 1 race engineer**.  
It is based on research, self-study, and guidance received from the **Motorsport Career Bot**.

The goal of this project is to:
- 🏎️ **Map out the complete Formula 1 engineering knowledge base** (vehicle dynamics, tyres, aero, electronics, data analysis, etc.).
- 📚 Provide a **structured list of books, topics, and study paths** for anyone dreaming of working in motorsport engineering.
- 🚀 Share an **open roadmap for transitioning into F1 engineering**, from coding and data analysis to trackside engineering.
